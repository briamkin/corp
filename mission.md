# Mission

We are on a mission to change the way that analytics is done. We believe that [analysts should work more like software engineers](https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/building-a-mature-analytics-workflow-the-analyst-collective-viewpoint-7653473ef05b), and we spend our time thinking about, implementing, building tools for, and training analysts on this workflow. Our mission animates everything about Fishtown Analytics: the way we work, the work we choose to do, the clients we work with, and the people we hire.

Our mission is almost hopelessly ambitious. The job “data analyst” became commonplace with the invention of the spreadsheet in the 1980’s, and analysts' core workflows haven’t changed much since then. Today, there are millions of analysts, and we want to change how each of them does their job. Inertia of this magnitude is almost impossible to overcome.

We care about our mission for a very simple reason: we want to help analysts be more effective. We’re analysts ourselves, and have personally witnessed a dramatic increase in our productivity implementing this workflow. We want to help others do the same.

The most likely outcome is that we will fail to achieve this mission. We are comfortable with this fact; the ever-present promise of failure motivates us every day. In order to maximize our chances of success, we have developed certain very particular ways of thinking about our business. Each of these principles touches almost everything we do.

**We optimize for the long term.** Our mission won’t be accomplished overnight. In fact, time is one of the biggest tools we have in our tool belt—communities take time to grow, and knowledge takes time to spread. We make decisions as an organization that allow us to think in terms of decades.

**We experiment on ourselves.** Our consulting business is not just a mechanism for us to earn revenue, it’s a laboratory for us to experiment on our workflow. Every consulting project is an experiment in which we can try out new improvements to our workflow and learn about how they react to direct contact with reality. We don’t evangelize any particular part of our workflow until we have implemented it ourselves.

**We hold our opinions and preferences loosely.** While we are confident in our vision for analytic workflow, there are a huge number of implementation questions for which we don’t claim to have the only answers. We treat our answers to all implementation questions as working hypotheses—the best answers we have at any given point in time—and are excited when we are presented with alternative ideas.

**We look for and invest in leverage.** We can’t accomplish our mission all by ourselves: it’s simply too large. Instead, we look for opportunities to leverage our time into much larger impacts. Building software is one way to multiply our impact. Another is catalyzing a community. We invest our time in areas that have the potential to create leverage, and are always on the lookout for more opportunities like this.
